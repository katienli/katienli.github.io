            <p>Ichigo Ice-cream is founded by Katie Li, a student at UC Berkeley. The name stems from Katie's love for strawberry flavored dessert, as Ichigo means strawberry in Japanese. When Katie studied abroad in Japan in 2014, she had the opportuntiy to eat a variety of good dessert, and those that stood out the most to her are all strawberry flavored. As Katie returned to the States, she began to learn French in college, immersing herself into French cuisine, especially developing interest in French dessert. While Katie is a business student at UC Berkeley, she is not so much interested in the same ideas as her classmates, like blockchain and machine learning; instead, Katie hopes to use good food to change her community. Through strawberry dessert, Katie hopes to share with customers her passion for delicious sweets and diverse cultures.
